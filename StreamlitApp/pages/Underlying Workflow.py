## Project Outline

The following are the outline steps that I will be performing: <u>text</u>

- Data collection: use BeautifulSoup to scrape property data from Trulia, a popular real estate website. Gather all listed variables that can be used for data analysis; download Census data through its API, a provider of data on the National, State, and Local levels that help define who we are as a nation and the makeup of the people that live in this country; download housing market data that is available on Redfin, a real estate company that offers services for buying, selling, renting, and financing homes.
- Data cleaning: read in data and prepare it for data analysis; steps include: tidy up the categorical features, deal with null value, etc.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): examine the cleaned data and its trends through Streamlit.
- Model building: determine which model (Linear, Lasso, XGBoost) work best (that return the smallest error) and tune the model with different parameters using GridSearchCV.
- Deploy Application: save all relevant files to a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chilam27/CMSE830_Project?tab=readme-ov-file) and deploy the application onto Streamlit Community Cloud."
