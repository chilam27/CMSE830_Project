## Property Sale Distribution

The first plot presented is the sale distribution histogram. From the histogram, we can observe that the distribution is right-skewed, with a few properties as outliers exceeding 1.5 million dollar. According to Trulia's website for the Boston region, the average sale price of a property is approximately 481,234 dollar. Additionally, we can see that the minimum listing price is $ 104,000, while the maximum listing price reaches 4,800,000 dollar.

## Sale and Neighborhood

For our next analysis, we will examine the distribution of sales based on neighborhoods. We provided two ways to view the data: through box plots and a map view. Generally, we observe that higher-value properties are usually located close to or in downtown areas, such as Chinatown. We also found that the highest-valued listing ($4.8 million) is located in Chinatown. As we move further south, property values tend to decrease.
